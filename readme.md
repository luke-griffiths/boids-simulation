# Boids simulation
A video of the boids can be found below. This webpage (and the video) will be updated by 11/15/22 once I get a chance to retake the video with a higher frame rate. 
The current video has boids that shimmer because the frame rate of the boids and the video are both 30fps. I'll retake at 60 fps soon.
