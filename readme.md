# Boids simulation
A video of the boids can be found below. This webpage (and the video) will be updated in January once I get a chance to retake the video with a higher frame rate. I also need to get permission from my prof about posting my code and a full description of what was done. 

The current video has boids that shimmer because the frame rate of the boids and the video are both 30fps. I'll retake at 60 fps soon to improve the quality.
